## SOMETHING WORTH NOTHING? 

A year back It was a mess trying to figure out what to do and what not to.I was asking here and there for advice, and it wasn't until I had to make a small project around January,2014 that I realized this 

Forever have we not wanted to finish 'the thing' we take up, after a few concentrated minutes/hours/weeks it all comes down to "man,I just want to finish this." This results in our transition from a dedicated learner to an idiotic soul,trying all the shortcuts one can while counituously telling ourselves, "this is not important,that is not important",and when on the important bit "it's taking too much time,if i just get stuck at it how will i finish",slowly but STEADILY we deceive our own-self, spiraling into chaos.And when somehow we manage to finish the task, we come to the realization that we may need to do it again,um..PROPERLY.
 Then what did we do in the first place,nothing? No,I like to call it 'something worth nothing.'
Same is the case with programming aspirants(including me), we run after things without realizing that what we were doing was apparently the right thing in the first place,and that things do take time.
After studying just the basics of a programming language, say C , we want to quickly make the transition to C++ or Java,but why?
